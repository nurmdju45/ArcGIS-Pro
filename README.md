## üî® Getting Started

1. **Install Required Software**:
   - [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview)
   - Python environment with `ArcPy` included (usually configured via the ArcGIS Pro Python environment).

2. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/geospatial-analysis-arcgis.git
   cd geospatial-analysis-arcgis


### Step 3: Run Scripts or Notebooks

- Navigate to the `scripts/` directory for standalone Python scripts.
- Explore the `notebooks/` directory to view Jupyter notebook examples interactively.

### Step 4: Data Preparation (Optional)

Place any required data files in the `data/` directory or adjust file paths in the scripts.

## üìò Examples

### **1. Creating a Buffer**

```python
import arcpy

# Input and output settings
input_fc = "roads.shp"
output_fc = "buffered_roads.shp"
buffer_distance = "100 Meters"

# Create a buffer
arcpy.Buffer_analysis(
    in_features=input_fc,
    out_feature_class=output_fc,
    buffer_distance_or_field=buffer_distance
)
print(f"Buffer created: {output_fc}")


## üíª Requirements

To run the scripts, ensure you have the following:

- **ArcGIS Pro**: Required for ArcPy support.
- **Python 3.x**: Compatible with the ArcGIS Pro Python environment.
- **Additional Libraries** (Optional):
  - `pandas` for tabular data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualization.
  - `osgeo` (GDAL/OGR) for advanced geospatial data handling.
